Assume that we are considering block with m coordinates in kth iteration:

The cost of BCD being operated on this single block in a single iteration (kth iteration) would be:
n*Func_G+(MULT+ADD)*   // Calculate the partial gradient vector
m*(MULT+ADD) // Update the coordinates in the block
m*ADD // Calculate the change of the coordinates 
n*m*(MULT+ADD) // Calculate the change of residual vector

The cost of BCD being operated on this single block in a single iteration APPLYING FL would be:


H = W'X_R + W'X_S

H = W'X_R_m + W'X_R_(n-m) + W'X_S

Improvement on single coordinate:
