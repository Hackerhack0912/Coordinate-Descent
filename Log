1. BCD(Shuffling V.S Non-Shuffling):not very obvious
   		
2. 1000 V.S 1024 (byte V.S GB) use GB

3. Cost Model for multi-table: how should model properly (parameters)
	
4. Algorithms for which the cost model is needed
	Stochastic Coordinate Descent:
		materialize, stream, factorize
	Block Coordinate Descent:
		materialize, stream (no cost-model), factorize

5. Comparison of techniques of Gradient Descent V.S Coordinate Descent
        The improvement (Does different functions influence much?)

	
6. What to be added?
